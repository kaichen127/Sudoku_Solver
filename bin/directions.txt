CS4750/7750 HW #6 (20 points) 
This is a group programming assignment. You may use any programming language in your 
implementation. 
 
In this assignment, you are asked to do the following tasks: 
• Implement  forward  checking  and  backtracking  search  with  MRV  and  degree 
heuristic to solve 9x9 Sudoku puzzle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku). Run 
forward check after each assignment during backtracking search.   
• When selecting which variable to be assigned values in backtracking search, break 
variable ties in the left to right (primary) and top to bottom (secondary) order. When 
selecting  the  values  to  be  assigned  to  a  variable,  break  value  ties  based  on  the 
increasing order of the values, i.e., 1, 2, etc.     
• Run  your  program  on  the  following  three  instances  to  find  a  solution  for  each 
instance. Terminate your program if it runs for more than one hour. 
 
a)    b)     c)   
 
Submission:     
1) (18 points) A pdf file of your report containing the following:   
a. (7  points)  A  description  of  your  CSP  problem  formulation  (define  the 
variables,  domains,  and  constrains)  and  implementation  of  forward 
checking and backtracking search with MRV and degree heuristic. If you 
use existing code, cite the sources. 
b. (8 points) For each of the three instances, print out the first 4 variable-value 
assignments in the backtracking search, including a) the variable selected, 
b) the domain size of the selected variable, c) the degree of the  selected 
variable, and d) the value assigned to the selected variable.   
c. (3 points) For each instance, report its solution and the corresponding CPU 
execution time in seconds. 
 
2) (2 points) A zip of pdf file containing your code with appropriate comments.
