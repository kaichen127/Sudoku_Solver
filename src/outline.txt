programs required:
something to check row, column, box, diagonal
backtrack search
3x3 array representation
multiple arrays rerpresenting each row, column, box, diagonal


functions required:
checkIfLegal(takes a coordinate and input)
checkRow
checkDiagonal
CheckColumn
CheckGroup

recursive function for backtrack search

function to return the element with the highest degree in the table
function to return the element with the least remaining values in the table

objects:
Sudoku
    3x3 arrray;

idea: 
    backwards search: 
    (? maybe have a function that returns the coordinate with least RM)
    if any coordinate has MRV = 0 and no value assigned, terminate
    new up a new board maybe ? (will also need to new all other variables)

    slow way: shove all unfilled points into a stack and keep sorting in order of MRV

    or recursive bool function: return false if unsolvable, true if keep searching
